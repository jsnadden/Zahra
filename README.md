This project was spawned from my desire to learn general game engine design, but I have since become enamoured specifically with graphics programming. For now, my focus will be developing the rendering system in order to grow/demonstrate my understanding of various rendering techniques. That said, I will probably invest some time in developing other systems here and there.

Recently (as of December '24) I've been working exclusively on swapping out the earlier OpenGL-based renderer with a more modern Vulkan implementation.

Currently working on the main branch (admittedly a non-standard arrangement), in order to put my recent progress on display. The preVulkan branch uses the OpenGL implementation, but has more working features (e.g. the level editor Meadow).
