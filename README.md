This started out as another attempt to learn game engine design, following TheCherno's youtube tutorials, but this lead to me falling in love with graphics programming. For now, my focus will be developing the rendering system in order to learn, and demonstrate my understanding of, various rendering techniques. That said, I will probably invest some time in developing other systems here and there.

Recently (as of December '24) I've been working exclusively on swapping out the initial OpenGL-based renderer with a more modern, versatile Vulkan implementation.

Currently working on the main branch (yeah I know, not best practices, but I want my recent progress on display). Checkout the preVulkan branch for the OpenGL implementation.
