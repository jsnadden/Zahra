This project was spawned from my desire to learn general game engine design, but I have since become enamoured specifically with graphics programming. For now, my focus will be developing the rendering system in order to grow/demonstrate my knowledge in this field. That said, I will probably invest some time in developing other systems here and there.

Recently (December '24) I've completed swapping out the earlier OpenGL-based renderer with a more modern Vulkan implementation, and have begun expanding its capabilities. My current goal is to implement a multi-pass physically-based scene renderer workflow, and to learn some advanced shading techniques in the process.
